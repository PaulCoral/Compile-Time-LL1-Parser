### A LL1 parser with compile time features

This package provide a library based on
[Scall1on](https://github.com/epfl-lara/scallion)
to build LL1 parser, which syntax analysis and (most of) the parser 
construction can be done at compile time using macros.

The library itself does not contain compile time code, but it is designed
to be used with Scala 3 macros without any issue.

To use it you should put the following things in **A SINGLE FILE**, so
that it can be used with macros

- `import ll1compiletime._`
- A macro call (inlined macro call + macro definition itself) 
with a call to [[ll1compiletime.buildParsingTable buildParsingTable]] with the syntax
definition created in the following point
- The syntax definition in an object exteded with the SyntayDefintion trait.
See the [[ll1compiletime.syntax.SyntaxDefinition operators]]


@example {{{
    /* macro inlined call */
    inline def getPartialParsingTable = ${init}

    /* macro definition */
    def init(using Quotes) = Expr(buildParsingTable(SyntaxDef))

    /* syntax defintion */
    object SyntaxDef extends SyntaxDefinition[Int,MyToken,MyKind] {
        // syntax defintion
    }
}}}
